# VTOL Performance Analyzer v2.0 - Required Dependencies
# ========================================================
#
# CORE DEPENDENCIES (Required for full functionality):
#

# Plotting and Visualization
matplotlib>=3.5.0          # For 2D/3D plots, performance curves, and sensitivity analysis
                           # Includes mpl_toolkits.mplot3d for 3D surface plots
numpy>=1.21.0              # For numerical calculations, meshgrid, and plot data

# Note: The tool will run in console-only mode without these,
# but 2D plots, 3D surface plots, and sensitivity analysis will not be generated.
#
# INSTALLATION:
# -------------
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# OR install individually:
# pip install matplotlib numpy
#
# OPTIONAL (for future enhancements):
# scipy>=1.7.0             # For advanced numerical analysis
# pandas>=1.3.0            # For data manipulation
