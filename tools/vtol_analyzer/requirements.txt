# VTOL Performance Analyzer v4.1 - Professional Edition
# ========================================================
#
# Python package requirements for both CLI and GUI modes
#

# CORE DEPENDENCIES (REQUIRED)
# -----------------------------
numpy>=1.20.0              # Numerical calculations, meshgrid, plot data
matplotlib>=3.5.0          # 2D/3D plots, performance curves, sensitivity analysis
                           # Includes mpl_toolkits.mplot3d for 3D surface plots
python-dateutil>=2.8.0     # Timestamp handling for sessions and exports

# OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES (Recommended)
# ------------------------------------
# Enhanced export features - tool will work without these but with reduced export options
reportlab>=3.6.0           # PDF export (falls back to text if not installed)
openpyxl>=3.0.10           # Excel export (falls back to CSV if not installed)
Pillow>=8.0.0              # Image handling for icons and plot exports

# FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Not yet required)
# ---------------------------------------
# Uncomment these when implementing advanced features:
# scipy>=1.7.0             # For optimization and sensitivity analysis (Phase E)
# pandas>=1.3.0            # For advanced data analysis and batch processing

# PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NOTES
# ------------------------
# tkinter (for GUI) - Usually included with Python installation
# If tkinter is not available:
#   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
#   macOS: brew install python-tk (if using Homebrew Python)
#   Windows: Reinstall Python with "tcl/tk" option checked

# INSTALLATION
# ------------
# Install all dependencies:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Or install individually:
#   pip install numpy matplotlib python-dateutil
#   pip install reportlab openpyxl Pillow  # Optional
#
# For development:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

# COMPATIBILITY
# -------------
# Verified compatible with:
# - Python 3.7+
# - Windows 10/11
# - macOS 10.14+ (Mojave and later)
# - Ubuntu 20.04+ / Debian 11+
# - Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye and later)

# MODES OF OPERATION
# ------------------
# 1. CLI Mode: Requires only numpy, matplotlib (can work without matplotlib in basic mode)
# 2. GUI Mode: Requires numpy, matplotlib, tkinter (python-dateutil recommended)
# 3. Full Mode: All dependencies for complete functionality
